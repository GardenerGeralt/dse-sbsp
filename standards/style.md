Code Style
-----------

How the code looks does not change its functionality, but
it can really improve the readability. For python, it is 
customary to use the PEP 8 standard.

### Naming Conventions

The naming style conventions are very important, so I believe 
they deserve a special mention. The following list shows which 
naming styles should be used in most situations:

- python files and modules: `lower_case_with_underscores`
- variables, functions, and methods: 
`lower_case_with_underscores`
- classes and class instances: `CamelCase`
- constants: `UPPERCASE`
- throwaway variable: `_` (just an underscore)

For more info on style, refer to the 
[PEP 8 Standard](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
However, most of the time, your IDE should tell you when your 
formatting is wrong.
